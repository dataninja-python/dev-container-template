1. I started by researching best practices to setup python projects.
2. I selected a directory, module, and file structure based on inspiration from several sources.
3. I manually set up a python project using this structure to confirm it would work.
4. I then created the "createPythonProject.sh" bash script.
5. I have gradually added to the script and will continue to do so.
